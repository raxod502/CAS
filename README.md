# CAS

This project was an attempt in high school to create a [Computer
algebra system
(CAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system), like
[Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/). Unfortunately, I
lacked an understanding of the fundamental abstractions that are
needed to implement such a system, so the project never really came to
fruition.
